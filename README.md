# coauthorship-graph

Construction of a _directed weighted co-authorship graph model_ for the **LAGOS-AND** dataset.

# Iput

The _input.csv_ file contains all the structured data that this step needs in order to compute the _directed weighted co-authorship graph model_

# Output

_calculated-data_ folder has a file for every step of the algorithm

1. _co_authorship_freq.json_
2. _total_co_authorship_freq_per_author.json_
3. _normalized_weights.json_

_normalized_weights.json_ is a representation of the _directed weighted co-authorship graph model_
