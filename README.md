# coauthorship-graph
Construction of a _directed weighted co-authorship graph model_ for the **LAGOS-AND** dataset.

# Iput
The _input.csv_ file contains all the structured data that this step needs in order to compute the _directed weighted co-authorship graph model_

# Output
_calculated-data_ folder has a file for every step of the algorithm
1. _exclusivity\_per\_pub.json_
2. _co\_authorship\_freq.json_
3. _total\_co\_authorship\_freq\_per\_author.json_
4. _normalized\_weights.json_

_normalized\_weights.json_ is a representation of the _directed weighted co-authorship graph model_
